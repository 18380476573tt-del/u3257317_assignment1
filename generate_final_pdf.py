# Executive Summary
pdf.chapter_title('Executive Summary')
summary = """
This project analyzes restaurant data using machine learning techniques, including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression models for rating prediction
- Classification models for rating categorization
- PySpark implementation (alternative approach)
- Reproducible workflow with Git and DVC

The analysis shows that restaurant ratings are influenced by several factors such as
cost, cuisine type, and geographic location. Machine learning models successfully
predict ratings with high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-driven
approaches for restaurant business analysis.

Regression Models Performance (Based on Actual Results):

Linear Regression (Scikit-Learn):
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0208
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1442
- Interpretation: Excellent performance with very low error

Gradient Descent (Manual Implementation):
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0195
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1396
- Interpretation: Slightly better than the scikit-learn implementation

Key Regression Insights:
- Both regression models showed excellent performance with very low MSE values
- The manual Gradient Descent implementation slightly outperformed scikit-learn
- Feature engineering expanded 130 original columns to 141 features
- Models were trained on 8,400 samples and tested on 2,100 samples
- Low MSE indicates highly accurate rating predictions
